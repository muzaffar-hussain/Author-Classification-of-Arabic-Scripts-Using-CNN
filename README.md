# Author-Classification-of-Arabic-Scripts-Using-CNN
In this repository I performed preprocessing on the images of old (arabic) scripts to turn the data to trainable format. The data-set used is not publicly available so I will use a sample data to start with. 


## Dependencies: 
The dependencies include:
- opencv-python==4.1.0.25
- imutils
- pandas==0.23.4
- tensorflow==1.14.0
- keras==2.2.4
- split_folders
- matplotlib==3.0.2
- Pillow==5.4.0
The requirement file is already included so you only have to run this command.
**`pip install -r requirements.txt`**

## Data Files:

Raw data should be copied in the folder raw_data. After that run the jupyter notebook & it will automatically pre-process the data.
